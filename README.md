Great that you've stumbled upon my GitHub profile :blush:

I'm a junior professor in the Cluster of Excellence [SimTech](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/) at the University of Stuttgart and a scientific software developer at heart. How are the two connected? Well, I strongly believe that passionate and sustainable scientific software development leads to better science. I'm not alone with this belief: Have a look at the [position paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01469) the [German RSE Community](https://de-rse.org/en/) recently formulated.

Since 2012, I've been one of the main developers of the [coupling library preCICE](https://www.precice.org/). Starting with two developers and two users, preCICE is now a community project with about a dozen developers and is used by over 60 research groups in academia, non-academic research centers and industry.

### Research Profile

I always use this sentence: Development of numerical methods and algorithms for multi-physics, multi-scale simulations, their efficient implementation on parallel systems, and their realization in easy-to-use, sustainable, and free software. So, quite interdisciplinary. Some buzzwords:
* **Numerics**: quasi-Newton methods, radial-basis function interpolation, waveform relaxation, uncertainty quantification
* **Computer Science**: high-performance computing, research software engineering, free and open-source software
* **Engineering**: fluid-structure interaction, fluid-acoustics coupling, turbulence modeling, finite element method

### Publications

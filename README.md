Great that you stumbled upon my GitHub profil :blush:. 

I am a postdoctoral researcher at [TU/e](https://www.tue.nl/en/) (Mechanical Engineering) and a scientific software developer by heart. How are both connected? Well, I strongly believe that passionate and sustainable scientific software development leads to better science. I am not alone with this believe. Have a look at the [position paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01469) the [German RSE Community](https://de-rse.org/en/) recently formulated. 

Since 2012, I am one of the main developers of the [coupling library preCICE](https://www.precice.org/). Starting with two developers and two users, preCICE is now a community project with a dozen of developers and is used by over 50 research groups and first R&D industrial partners.

### Publications

You can find my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=CGxtmcwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Benjamin_Uekermann).

### Research Profile

I always use this sentence: Development of numerical methods and algorithms for multi-physics multi-scale simulations, their efficient implementation on parallel systems, and their realization in easy-to-use, sustainable, and free software. So, quite interdisciplinary. Some buzzwords:
* **Numerics**: quasi-Newton methods, radial-basis function interpolation, waveform relaxation, uncertainty quantification
* **Computer Science**: high-performance computing, research software engineering, free and open-source software
* **Engineering**: fluid-structure interaction, fluid-acoustics coupling, turbulence modeling, finite element method
